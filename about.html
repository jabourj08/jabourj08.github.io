                I grew up in the city of Sterling Heights, MI where I started school in the Utica school district. In the 3rd grade, my family and I moved not too far away in Sterling Heights, putting me in the Warren school district where I completed 4th through 7th
                grade. After the 7th grade, my family and I moved to Washington Township where I finished out grade school in Romeo (2008). From there I have moved several more times over the years, finally landing in Clinton Township where I reside today.
                During that time, I have obtained an Associate Degree of Applied Science with the focus in Web Development.

                <b>My Interests</b><br><br> All growing up I played a mixture of hardball and softball for 16 years. Baseball has been the only physical sport I have played other than Bowling (which I played on several teams throughout the years). Currently
                I have been enjoying playing Golf with friends, although my scores are not the best. Aside from sports, I enjoy going to EDM shows in various places including music festivals (Yes, I have Robot ears).
